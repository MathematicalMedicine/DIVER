# DIVER

Tracking integrated versioned components for the NRGR DIVER application.

All actual development takes place in the repos for those components, rather than in this repo; this is just how we keep track of what component versions come together for the final package. (We don't even track that final package version here; that's eventually going to be embedded in the components.) just addresses what's actually deployed. We do, however, do issue tracking here.

Component repos are currently restricted-access. Whether or not that changes is still being reviewed.

This readme or another document in this repo may eventually supersede the [Just Deployed On DIVER](https://app.simplenote.com/p/K4PTYW) development tracking document but that decision has not yet been finalized.
